# Rules

## Game Start

Each player starts with two cards and 2 credits.

Cards grant permission to perform certain actions.

However, players can lie and perform any action.

## Taking Turns

On a given turn, the leader starts by choosing an action. Available actions are listed below.

Other players can then either block or challenge the chosen action.

### Challenges

If a player does not believe the leader has the card required to perform their action, they can challenge them. If the leader does have the card, the challenger must lose a card - otherwise, the leader loses a card and the turn is over.

### Blocking

Certain actions can be blocked by certain cards. A player can claim to have the required card and block an action - for example, blocking Assassinate with the Contessa. The leader can challenge this block using the rules defined above, or accept it and end the turn.
